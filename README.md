  ## Tools
  - **Solana Playground IDE**: Used for initial development and testing of Solana programs. It provides an easy-to-use interface to write, deploy, and test Solana smart contracts without needing extensive local setup.
- **VSCode**: Used for advanced development and editing. VSCode provides powerful extensions for Rust, TypeScript, and Solana development, allowing for a more integrated and efficient coding environment.
